    Since We have not created any site with signup form we will reach to site creation page.
    = image_tag('create_a_site')
    Create a site with sign up form title and description (both are optional)
    = image_tag('now_we_have_a_site_with_sign_up_form')
    Go to dashboard and start adding signup form questions.
